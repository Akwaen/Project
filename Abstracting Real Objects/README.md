The Truck and Engine Management System is a program that helps you manage trucks and their engines. The main goal is to let users create and modify Truck objects, which can be connected to different types of Engine. Users can expect a simple way to work with these vehicles, and the program has built-in checks to make sure all data is correct. What makes this program special is its focus on object-oriented design, which makes it easy to add new features later.

Key features of this program include:
- Create and manage trucks with different attributes.
- Define various engine types with checks to ensure valid inputs.
- Easily get and update truck and engine details using simple methods.
- Clear logs of truck information through a handy toString() method.

The program is organized into two main classes: Truck and Engine. The Truck class includes important details like brand, color, number of seats, towing capacity, and a reference to an Engine object. The Engine class focuses on the type of engine used.

The Truck class connects with the Engine class by using an engine instance, letting truck objects access and change engine details. Data is stored in the class's attributes. The design draws on the principles of object-oriented programming, making everything easy to understand and use. You can see a UML diagram of how everything fits together (insert link or image here).

To run the program, first, clone the repository to your computer. Then, open the project. Then compile the Java files to check for errors, and run the Main class to see the trucks and engines in action. For sample inputs, try creating trucks with different engine types, such as "V8" or "Electric."

During development, I made sure to organise everything on a google document. Our main goal was to create a working program for managing trucks and engines. We faced some challenges, especially with input validation and keeping the code clean. In the future, we’d like to add even more features, like a system to manage truck inventories.

This project was created by Akwaeno George. I learned a lot about object-oriented programming and how to create structures that are easy to maintain.
